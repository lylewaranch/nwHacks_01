# CARETT

## Concept

CARETT, partly inspired by Google's CAPTCHA feature, uses augmented reality technology to test whether or not a user is human. The test accesses users' cameras and asks them to identify the objects in front of them. By going one step beyond simple image recognition software, CARETT is a 2018 solution to cyber security dilemmas.

CARETT stands for Complete Augmented REality Turing Test.
